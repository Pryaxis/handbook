# Who are the members of Pryaxis?

This section is kind of built in the principle that we can add more non-leaders in the future. Right now, it's just leaders and guests. Every person that can see #high-charity is either a leader or a guest.

<!-- Make sure, when editing this document, that you always list GitHub usernames as the first thing, followed by their Discord nickname. -->

Other documents make reference only to "leaders." Leaders includes both the root users and the leaders, for simplicity sake. Except where explicitly called out, all leaders and root users are effectively at the same "rank" in most operations.

When a leader posts on the forums, replies to an issue on GitHub, or chats in Discord, they're speaking on the same playing field as everyone else.

## Root Users

The people listed as root have been with Pryaxis consistently and reliably for a long time. They're considered the rotating highest point of contact. Major policy decisions require them to approve or at least abstain on the decision. These members typically have the highest technical leadership as well as other more nuanced roles associated with them. In effect, root users are the "sysadmins" of our organization.

All root users have the root role on Discord, which grants "Administrator" rights including permission overrides on all actions.

* @hakusaro (Discord: hakusaro#6463)
  * Operates ```arc```, the server that runs TShock's forums, update server, and other micro services attached to TShock.
  * Operates most TShock and Pryaxis related domains.
  * Operates Twitter.
  * Is an owner of @Pryaxis on GitHub.
  * Is the Discord owner for TShock.
* @QuiCM (Discord: Cold#7366)
  * Is an owner of @Pryaxis on GitHub.
  * Has Twitter access.
* @Ijwu (Discord: Ijwu#7209)

## Leaders

Leaders of Pryaxis are the people who run the operation. Every leader is equivalent. Every leader has the _technical_ ability to push code to TShock, though we discourage people from doing so in modern times (we prefer GitHub flow and the two-man rule from now on). The only things they can't do are: publish official TShock updates and perform technical actions they haven't yet been granted access to. We're working on this one.

* @DeathCradle (Discord: death#6133)
* @Celant (Discord: Jish#0319)
  * Operates the stat tracker Heroku instance and backend DB.
  * Is legal data handler concerning stats data in the UK.

* @Enerdy (Discord: Enerdy#8912)
* @MarioE (Discord: marioe#7557)
* @Patrikkk (Discord: Patrikk#4016)
* @mistzzt (Discord: mist#3706)
  * Due to technical incompetence on the part of @hakusaro, Mist did not get moved to the new Pryaxis org when we made the switch from Nyx. Doh. Currently being fixed.
* @ProfessorXZ (Discord: Ivan#0667)
* @tylerjwatson (Discord: wolfje#6084)
* @Zaicon (Discord: Zaicon#1719)
  * Due to technical incompetence on the part of @hakusaro, Zaicon did not get moved to the new Pryaxis org when we made the switch from Nyx. Doh. Currently being fixed.
* DaBomber (Discord: Da Bomber | 폭탄병#9235)
  * Has Twitter account access.

## Guests

Guests in the #high-charity Discord room have the technical capacity to, in the event of an emergency, act as first responders to disasters. This includes deleting messages, kicking, or banning spammers. They do not have voting rights on decisions we as a group make as a whole, nor do they have the ability to _speak on behalf of Pryaxis_.

* Elliott from Multiplay UK (Nibbler#6533)
* Re-Logic Staff

# What if the root users disappear?

If a leader can't reach a root user that's important, then it's imperative that all systems remain online and operational. All roles previously assigned to root only users are now up for grabs by anyone, with the two-man rule in place. We currently have no recovery plan if all three root users are hit by a bus, or if @hakusaro is hit by a bus and literally nobody else has access to ```arc```. We're working on this!
